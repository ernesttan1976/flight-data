### Brief 
The dashboard or app has to be useful for a flight planner to decide how to plan a mission or for a pilot to decide how he might want to fly a flight profile. Given this, how should we investigate the data to determine a representation that yould help him/her. With this in mind, what does the data tell us? GPS Jamming is like encountering turbulence on route. It's undesirable for flight, but it's usually not a safety hazard unless it's large and unexpected. 
It is terrible for munitions that rely on this for guidance. But these profiles can be adjusted. You have access to pilots and planners who would fly these things. So we'll help to provide some context to how the data may be investigated. But do look at the raw data and see what it can tell you. 
Maybe you want to try unsupervised learning to see if there are distinct categories. And then investigate what are the common factors in these clusters? Do the EDA and see what hidden insights there are. Then you can decide on the best representation of the data.

### Exploratory Questions Summary
 Q1. Sources of Truth: What are the sources of truth for GPS interference? 
 Q2. Correlation: How is GPS signal affected by altitude? Speed? Is there any strong correlation?
 Q3. Analysis: Select some sample flights within an area and examine the GPS drop off characteristics. Select a few known GPS jammed/spoofed areas and a known GPS safe area as a baseline. What does the data tell us?
 Q4. Classification: From what is learnt in Q3, what algorithm can we use to classify the area on GPS interference? 
 Q5. Presentation: What data is useful to pilots when describing an area of GPS interference? What is the best way to present this data?

### Q1. Sources of Truth - What are the sources of truth for GPS interference?
1. ADSB api is certainly one of them. 
2. Flight plans are not followed exactly so comparing flight plans with actual paths is not reliable. 
3. Radar returns are another source of truth, but these are not readily available. 

### Q2. Correlation: How is GPS signal correlated with altitude? Speed? Other parameters? Is there any strong correlation?

### Q3. Analysis: What are the GPS drop off characteristics?
Select some sample flights within an area and examine the GPS drop off characteristics. 
Select a few known GPS jammed/spoofed areas and known GPS safe areas as a baseline. What does the data tell us?

### Q4. Classification: From what is learnt in Q3, what algorithm can we use to classify the area on GPS interference?

### Q5. Presentation: What data is useful to pilots when describing an area of GPS interference? What is the best way to present this data?
